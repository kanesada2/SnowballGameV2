# SnowballGame
SnowballGame is a Bukkit plugin that lets you play baseball in Minecraft.
It's compatible with Spigot/Paper 1.21.1.

## SnowballGameV2
This repository contains a Kotlin rewrite of SnowballGame.
The original version can be found at: https://github.com/kanesada2/SnowballGame/

## Notice
I no longer plan to maintain this plugin. This version(2.0.0) will be the final release.
